# Chat Backend

This project was meant to create a backend for a chat-based application to emit messages to several users.
This project is the bare minimum and would require specialization to continue. As such, I've decided to create a superset of this project.

The new project will implement almost every chat feature here and be used to create a Mafia psychology based game via a messaging system.
See [this repository]() for more information.
